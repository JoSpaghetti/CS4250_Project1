common born they most like marri onli after thutmos becam king 3 henc their son would be born after hi father s coron and probabl after hi half sister hatshepsut who wa the pharaoh s daughter by hi

twenti long reign upon hi death reign edit date and length of reign edit the epitom by manetho refer to thutmos ii as chebron and credit thi ruler with a reign of 13 year the greek name may reflect a version of the prenomen aakheperenr egyptologist debat whether thutmos ii had a short or long reign some suggest a short reign of three year base on hi highest attest date is year 1 ii akhet day 8 stele 9 there are onli a small number of surviv document and a minim amount of scarab attest to thi king it is still possibl to estim when thutmos ii s reign would have begun by mean of a heliac rise of sothi in amenhotep i s reign which would give him a reign from 1493 to 1479 bc 10 although uncertainti about how to interpret the rise also permit a date from 1513 to 1499 bc 11 and uncertainti

of new kingdom offici a clear count of monument from hi rule which is the princip tool for estim a king s reign when date document are not avail is nearli imposs becaus hatshepsut usurp most of hi monument and thutmos iii in turn reinscrib thutmos ii s name indiscrimin over other monument 16 howev apart from sever surviv block of build erect by the king at semna kumma and elephantin thutmos ii s onli major monument consist of a limeston gateway at karnak that onc lay at the front of the fourth pylon s forecourt even thi monument wa not complet in thutmos ii s reign but in the reign of hi
