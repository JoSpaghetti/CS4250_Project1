some review comment on draft finit suggest you ask for help at the teahous but unless you make it clear what you are ask for we re not go to be abl to help you much what i will say is that a wikipedia articl should be a summari of what reliabl sourc say about the subject and veri littl els it doesn t look to me as if ani of your cite sourc talk specif about the concept of finit it s possibl that the third one ha a section on finit but a search in the internet archiv didn t turn up anyth there are two consequ of thi first everyth in your draft is either unsourc or not about finit secondli notabl as wikipedia use the word is crucial depend on sourc colinfin talk 20 17 22 februari 2025 utc repli sourc which refer the concept of finit do not alway do so use that particular term

someon could explain what reject mean not to disput that your draft did not deserv to be reject there is no potenti to salvag the draft pleas put it out of it miseri by put db author at the top insid doubl curli bracket so that an administr will be notifi to delet the draft if finit deserv an articl perhap in time someon will compos it but bring it to the attent of the generalist at teahous is not the way to find that person david notmd talk 20 57 22 februari 2025 utc repli the problem is that your draft look like a dictionari entri wiktionari is our correspond dictionari we alreadi have an articl on finit in math howev there is no articl on finit be so if you do want to write on the topic find sourc and expand on that philosoph theolog aspect graem bartlett talk 21 31 22 februari 2025 utc repli finit current redirect to finit a disambigu page from 2007 until veri recent it also offer a singl sentenc of explan attempt to describ what finit mean state finit is the opposit of infinit on the talk page i comment that the explan wa circular two other editor suggest that it might be a good idea to write a finit articl my draft is short make it look more like a dictionari articl but it focus on the state of be limit or end as oppos to focus on the term finit as is appropri in a dictionari kevincook13 talk 23 48 22 februari 2025 utc repli robert mcclenon i did request that you withdraw the reject i appreci the discuss we had and your express willing to continu it here along with other experienc editor i would like to discuss the lead paragraph doe the lead paragraph describ a concept as is appropri for an encyclopedia or doe it describ a term as is appropri for a dictionari doe it describ a notabl concept doe it contribut meaning to wikipedia as would be expect from a lead paragraph in which way doe the lead paragraph detract from wikipedia if the lead paragraph doe describ a notabl concept as would be expect then is the entir articl worthi of delet you suggest that you would be will to accept the articl with the warn that it might be nomin for delet i definit do not want you to accept an articl that you esteem a candid for delet i thought that editor accept articl becaus they are accept not becaus do so facilit delet kevincook13 talk 05 25 23 februari 2025 utc repli robert_mcclenon you are the one who want to move thi discuss between you and i to the teahous which i start on your talk page and which you took to mine you told me that you would have particip in the origin teahous discuss if it weren t for the fact that you didn t notic it befor it wa archiv you said that you alway particip in discuss of articl that you have review as long as you are awar of them are you plan to particip if you are pleas add a littl note here to let us know kevincook13 talk 18 38 24 februari 2025 utc repli david notmd one of the thing that support appreci about wikipedia is that editor freeli exchang idea rather than simpli make or compli with demand kevincook13 talk 16 07 24 februari 2025 utc repli what part of if there is to be an articl on thi topic thi draft must first be blown up and start over do you not understand 05 45 23 februari 2025 utc my question i see that one editor ha state correctli that i reject the draft and that that mean that discuss is finish so i think that i am ask the other experienc editor here whether they agre that i wa right in reject thi draft or whether i should have onli declin it again and also whether there is ani procedur for discuss a draft or a topic after a draft ha been reject do the other editor think that user kevincook13 should be abl to rework it i am sort of uneasi with the idea that reject is final final if the draft wa submit by a good faith editor which in thi case it wa if reject is final final then mayb i should never reject a draft that is submit by a good faith editor some draft that are reject are submit either by conflict of interest editor or by troll i am not ask about them thi draft wa submit by a good faith editor whom i think ha gone down a rabbit hole is there ani way that a good faith editor whose draft is reject can discuss rework or start over and is there a way that a review can ask for third parti comment on their decis to reject an articl if not mayb i shouldn t reject draft by good faith editor becaus i don t want to make a final final judgment against good faith submiss also i made an offer to user kevincook13 that i wa will to revert my accept and accept the draft with the understand that it wa like to be nomin for delet i wa will to let the submitt get hi draft into mainspac and let the commun be the gatekeep what i would do would be to request that the block redirect be delet or move so that the draft can be move to mainspac is kevincook13 readi for that those are my question for the other editor and for the submitt robert mcclenon talk 19 19 24 februari 2025 utc repli as a non afc review i have no opinion over whether the draft should have been reject over be declin or let it pass through to mainspac to be afd ed by other editor what i can say after look at the draft is that it is in it current form inappropri for an encyclopedia the thought aren t organis and the tone sound off tenryuu 21 44 24 februari 2025 utc repli thank you user tenryuu in that case your opinion equat to say that i should not have accept it becaus the instruct for afc review are to accept if we think that the draft ha more than a 50 of pass afd what i am say to the author is that i am will to accept the draft without make a judgment as to whether it will surviv afd if that is what the author request i don t want to make a one editor judgment that a draft should be abandon robert mcclenon talk 00 22 25 februari 2025 utc repli thank user tenryuu

languag it wa accept and is a valid wiki page in jp i use the translat to english option to get to that page s sourc sinc i am not japanes fluent that wiki page s sourc wa veri scant much of the sourc i have done is my own research to fulfil the origin english wiki respons about lack of sourc do you think i am tri to includ too much on the histori of thi person i have seen mani martial artist of the 19th centuri list in wiki with less impact on martial art either dead art now or just veri minim info who are like less notabl to the martial art than nakayama base on current day adher popul imo nakayama is as vastli import to ten of thousand of wado karat folk around the world for if he didn t exist wado ryu would not exist he is also notabl for the exist extand shindo yoshin ryu school around the world that also are awar of hi histor contribut as well as hi high level kendo swordsmanship skill as honor by the dai nippon butokukai notabl is in the japanes martial art world not as much as the world in gener but asid from the wado ryu founder nakayama and gichin funakoshi are the most notabl peopl of thi style that could not exist without their contribut i just want hi indel contribut document also i realiz some of the sourc from the jp wiki page are magazin articl that are onli avail in japanes languag and some are also 20 year out of print so their specif usag for sourc is limit my thought on still includ some of them is becaus they did exist and do have those articl and for someon that ha them or run across them or can read japanes they might be a use resourc in the futur i may be wrong in my thought but to have a citat of a sourc even it present day difficult or not readili access still doesn t remov the origin materi for exampl blackbelt magazin 1 might be difficult to find today in 2025 but it did exist mani decad ago and did have use info within it i hope that make sens my initi thought wa to includ all prior sourc as abl from the publish jp wiki page assum ye i know that is danger they were valid sourc at some time in the past and should still be valid even if difficult to find in 2025 if i should remov some sourc citat to make the draft pass
