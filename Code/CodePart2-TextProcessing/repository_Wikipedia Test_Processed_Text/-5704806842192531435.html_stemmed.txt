to be poison to trogon though like arsenura armida the extent to which each food type is taken vari depend on geographi and speci the three african trogon are exclus insectivor wherea the asian and

most commonli employ forag techniqu is a salli glean flight where a trogon fli from an observ perch to a target on anoth branch or in foliag onc there the bird hover or stall and snatch the item befor return to it perch to consum the item thi type of forag is commonli use by some type of bird to obtain insect prey in trogon and quetzal it is also use to pluck fruit from tree insect prey may also be taken on the wing with the trogon pursu fli insect in a similar manner to drongo and old world flycatch frog lizard and larg insect on the ground may also be pounc on from the air more rare some
