area of specialis or subdisciplin that continu to increas in number and interrel to creat further interdisciplinari field of studi the applic of variou field of chemistri are use frequent for econom purpos in the chemic industri etymolog main articl etymolog of chemistri the word chemistri come from a modif dure the renaiss of the word alchemi which refer to an earlier set of practic that encompass element of chemistri metallurgi philosophi astrolog astronomi mystic and medicin alchemi is often associ with the quest to turn lead or other base metal into gold though alchemist were also interest in mani of the question of modern chemistri 9 10 the modern word alchemi in turn is deriv from the arab word al kīmīā الكیمیاء thi may have egyptian origin sinc al kīmīā is deriv from the ancient greek χημία which is in turn deriv from the word kemet which is the ancient name of egypt in the egyptian languag 11 altern al kīmīā may deriv from χημεία cast togeth 12 modern principl laboratori institut of biochemistri univers of cologn in germani the current model of atom structur is the quantum mechan model 13 tradit chemistri start with the studi of elementari particl atom molecul 14 substanc metal crystal and other aggreg of matter matter can be studi in solid liquid ga and plasma state in isol or in combin the interact reaction and transform that are studi in chemistri are usual the result of interact between atom lead to rearrang of the chemic bond which hold atom togeth such behavior are studi in a chemistri laboratori the chemistri laboratori stereotyp use variou form of laboratori glasswar howev glasswar is not central to chemistri and a great deal of experiment as well as appli industri chemistri is done without it solut of substanc in reagent bottl includ ammonium hydroxid and nitric acid illumin in differ color a chemic reaction is a transform of some substanc into one or more differ substanc 15 the basi of such a chemic transform is the rearrang of electron in the chemic bond between atom it can be symbol depict through a chemic equat which usual involv atom as subject the number of atom on the left and the right in the equat for a chemic transform is equal when the number of atom on either side is unequ the transform is refer to as a nuclear reaction or radioact decay the type of chemic reaction a substanc may undergo and the energi chang that may accompani it are constrain by certain basic rule known as chemic law energi and entropi consider are invari import in almost all chemic studi chemic substanc are classifi in term of their structur phase as well as their chemic composit they can be analyz use the tool of chemic analysi e g spectroscopi and chromatographi scientist engag in chemic research are known as chemist 16 most chemist special in one or more sub disciplin sever concept are essenti for the studi of chemistri some of them are 17 matter main articl matter in chemistri matter is defin as anyth that ha rest mass and volum it take up space and is made up of particl the particl that make up matter have rest mass as well not all particl have rest mass such as the photon matter can be a pure chemic substanc or a mixtur of substanc 18 atom main articl atom a diagram of an atom base on the rutherford model the atom is the basic unit of chemistri it consist of a dens core call the atom nucleu surround by a space occupi by an electron cloud the nucleu is made up of posit charg proton and uncharg neutron togeth call nucleon while the electron cloud consist of neg charg electron which orbit the nucleu in a neutral atom the neg charg electron balanc out the posit charg of the proton the nucleu is dens the mass of a nucleon is approxim 1 836 time that of an electron yet the radiu of an atom is about 10 000 time that of it nucleu 19 20 the atom is also the smallest entiti that can be envisag to retain the chemic properti of the element such as electroneg ioniz potenti prefer oxid state s coordin number and prefer type of bond to form e g metal ionic coval element standard form of the period tabl of chemic element the color repres differ block of element main articl chemic element a chemic element is a pure substanc which is compos of a singl type of atom character by it particular number of proton in the nuclei of it atom known as the atom number and repres by the symbol z the mass number is the sum of the number of proton and neutron in a nucleu although all the nuclei of all atom belong to one element will have the same atom number they may not necessarili have the same mass number atom of an element which have differ mass number are known as isotop for exampl all atom with 6 proton in their nuclei are atom of the chemic element carbon but atom of carbon may have mass number of 12 or 13 20 the standard present of the chemic element is in the period tabl which order element by atom number the period tabl is arrang in group or column and period or row the period tabl is use in identifi period trend 21 compound carbon dioxid co 2 an exampl of a chemic compound main articl chemic compound a compound is a pure chemic substanc compos of more than one element the properti of a compound bear littl similar to those of it element 22 the standard nomenclatur of compound is set by the intern union of pure and appli chemistri iupac organ compound are name accord to the organ nomenclatur system 23 the name for inorgan compound are creat accord to the inorgan nomenclatur system when a compound ha more than one compon then they are divid into two class the electroposit and the electroneg compon 24 in addit the chemic abstract servic ha devis a method to index chemic substanc in thi scheme each chemic substanc is identifi by a number known as it ca registri number molecul main articl molecul a ball and stick represent of the caffein molecul c 8 h 10 n 4 o 2 a molecul is the smallest indivis portion of a pure chemic substanc that ha it uniqu set of chemic properti that is it potenti to undergo a certain set of chemic reaction with other substanc howev thi definit onli work well for substanc that are compos of molecul which is not true of mani substanc see below molecul are typic a set of atom bound togeth by coval bond such that the structur is electr neutral and all valenc electron are pair with other electron either in bond or in lone pair thu molecul exist as electr neutral unit unlik ion when thi rule is broken give the molecul a charg the result is sometim name a molecular ion or a polyatom ion howev the discret and separ natur of the molecular concept usual requir that molecular ion be present onli in well separ form such as a direct beam in a vacuum in a mass spectromet charg polyatom collect resid in solid for exampl common sulfat or nitrat ion are gener not consid molecul in chemistri some molecul contain one or more unpair electron creat radic most radic are compar reactiv but some such as nitric oxid no can be stabl a 2 d structur formula of a benzen molecul c 6 h 6 the inert or nobl ga element helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are compos of lone atom as their smallest discret unit but the other isol chemic element consist of either molecul or network of atom bond to each other in some way identifi molecul compos familiar substanc such as water air and mani organ compound like alcohol sugar gasolin and the variou pharmaceut howev not all substanc or chemic compound consist of discret molecul and inde most of the solid substanc that make up the solid crust mantl and core of the earth are chemic compound without molecul these other type of substanc such as ionic compound and network solid are organ in such a way as to lack the exist of identifi molecul per se instead these substanc are discuss in term of formula unit or unit cell as the smallest repeat structur within the substanc exampl of such substanc are miner salt such as tabl salt solid like carbon and diamond metal and familiar silica and silic miner such as quartz and granit one of the main characterist of a molecul is it geometri often call it structur while the structur of diatom triatom or tetra atom molecul may be trivial linear angular pyramid etc the structur of polyatom molecul that are constitut of more than six atom of sever element can be crucial for it chemic natur substanc and mixtur exampl of pure chemic substanc from left to right the element tin sn and sulfur s diamond an allotrop of carbon sucros pure sugar and sodium chlorid salt and sodium bicarbon bake soda which are both ionic compound a chemic substanc is a kind of matter with a definit composit and set of properti 25 a collect of substanc is call a mixtur exampl of mixtur are air and alloy 26 mole and amount of substanc main articl mole the mole is a unit of measur that denot an amount of substanc also call chemic amount one mole is defin to contain exactli 6 022 140 76 10 23 particl atom molecul ion or electron where the number of particl per mole is known as the avogadro constant 27 molar concentr is the amount of a particular substanc per volum of solut and is commonli report in mol dm 3 28 phase diagram show relationship among the phase and the term use to describ phase chang main articl phase in addit to the specif chemic properti that distinguish differ chemic classif chemic can exist in sever phase for the most part the chemic classif are independ of these bulk phase classif howev some more exot phase are incompat with certain chemic properti a phase is a set of state of a chemic system that have similar bulk structur properti over a rang of condit such as pressur or temperatur physic properti such as densiti and refract index tend to fall within valu characterist of the phase the phase of matter is defin by the phase transit which is when energi put into or taken out of the system goe into rearrang the structur of the system instead of chang the bulk condit sometim the distinct between phase can be continu instead of have a discret boundari in thi case the matter is consid to be in a supercrit state when three state meet base on the condit it is known as a tripl point and sinc thi is invari it is a conveni way to defin a set of condit the most familiar exampl of phase are solid liquid and gase mani substanc exhibit multipl solid phase for exampl there are three phase of solid iron alpha gamma and delta that vari base on temperatur and pressur a princip differ between solid phase is the crystal structur or arrang of the atom anoth phase commonli encount in the studi of chemistri is the aqueou phase which is the state of substanc dissolv in aqueou solut that is in water less familiar phase includ plasma bose einstein condens and fermion condens and the paramagnet and ferromagnet phase of magnet materi while most familiar phase deal with three dimension system it is also possibl to defin analog in two dimension system which ha receiv attent for it relev to system in biolog bond main articl chemic bond an anim of the process of ionic bond between sodium na and chlorin cl to form sodium chlorid or common tabl salt ionic bond involv one atom take valenc electron from anoth as oppos to share which occur in coval bond atom stick togeth in molecul or crystal are said to be bond with one anoth a chemic bond may be visual as the multipol balanc between the posit charg in the nuclei and the neg charg oscil about them 29 more than simpl attract and repuls the energi and distribut character the avail of an electron to bond to anoth atom the chemic bond can be a coval bond an ionic bond a hydrogen bond or just becaus of van der waal forc each of these kind of bond is ascrib to some potenti these potenti creat the interact which hold atom togeth in molecul or crystal in mani simpl compound valenc bond theori the valenc shell electron pair repuls model vsepr and the concept of oxid number can be use to explain molecular structur and composit an ionic bond is form when a metal lose one or more of it electron becom a posit charg cation and the electron are then gain by the non metal atom becom a neg charg anion the two opposit charg ion attract one anoth and the ionic bond is the electrostat forc of attract between them for exampl sodium na a metal lose one electron to becom an na cation while chlorin cl a non metal gain thi electron to becom cl the ion are held togeth due to electrostat attract and that compound sodium chlorid nacl or common tabl salt is form in the methan molecul ch 4 the carbon atom share a pair of valenc electron with each of the four hydrogen atom thu the octet rule is satisfi for c atom it ha eight electron in it valenc shell and the duet rule is satisfi for the h atom they have two electron in their valenc shell in a coval bond one or more pair of valenc electron are share by two atom the result electr neutral group of bond atom is term a molecul atom will share valenc electron in such a way as to creat a nobl ga electron configur eight electron in their outermost shell for each atom atom that tend to combin in such a way that they each have eight electron in their valenc shell are said to follow the octet rule howev some element like hydrogen and lithium need onli two electron in their outermost shell to attain thi stabl configur these atom are said to follow the duet rule and in thi way they are reach the electron configur of the nobl ga helium which ha two electron in it outer shell similarli theori from classic physic can be use to predict mani ionic structur with more complic compound such as metal complex valenc bond theori is less applic and altern approach such as the molecular orbit theori are gener use energi main articl energi in the context of chemistri energi is an attribut of a substanc as a consequ of it atom molecular or aggreg structur sinc a chemic transform is accompani by a chang in one or more of these kind of structur it is invari accompani by an increas or decreas of energi of the substanc involv some energi is transfer between the surround and the reactant of the reaction in the form of heat or light thu the product of a reaction may have more or less energi than the reactant a reaction is said to be exergon if the final state is lower on the energi scale than the initi state in the case of endergon reaction the situat is the revers a reaction is said to be exotherm if the reaction releas heat to the surround in the case of endotherm reaction the reaction absorb heat from the surround chemic reaction are invari not possibl unless the reactant surmount an energi barrier known as the activ energi the speed of a chemic reaction at given temperatur t is relat to the activ energi e by the boltzmann s popul factor e e k t displaystyl e e kt that is the probabl of a molecul to have energi greater than or equal to e at the given temperatur t thi exponenti depend of a reaction rate on temperatur is known as the arrheniu equat the activ energi necessari for a chemic reaction to occur can be in the form of heat light electr or mechan forc in the form of ultrasound 30 a relat concept free energi which also incorpor entropi consider is a veri use mean for predict the feasibl of a reaction and determin the state of equilibrium of a chemic reaction in chemic thermodynam a reaction is feasibl onli if the total chang in the gibb free energi is neg δ g 0 displaystyl delta g leq 0 if it is equal to zero the chemic reaction is said to be at equilibrium there exist onli limit possibl state of energi for electron atom and molecul these are determin by the rule of quantum mechan which requir quantiz of energi of a bound system the atom molecul in a higher energi state are said to be excit the molecul atom of substanc in an excit energi state are often much more reactiv that is more amen to chemic reaction the phase of a substanc is invari determin by it energi and the energi of it surround when the intermolecular forc of a substanc are such that the energi of the surround is not suffici to overcom them it occur in a more order phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water h 2 o a liquid at room temperatur becaus it molecul are bound by hydrogen bond 31 wherea hydrogen sulfid h 2 s is a ga at room temperatur and standard pressur as it molecul are bound by weaker dipol dipol interact the transfer of energi from one chemic substanc to anoth depend on the size of energi quanta emit from one substanc howev heat energi is often transfer more easili from almost ani substanc to anoth becaus the phonon respons for vibrat and rotat energi level in a substanc have much less energi than photon invok for the electron energi transfer thu becaus vibrat and rotat energi level are more close space than electron energi level heat is more easili transfer between substanc rel to light or other form of electron energi for exampl ultraviolet electromagnet radiat is not transfer with as much efficaci from one substanc to anoth as thermal or electr energi the exist of characterist energi level for differ chemic substanc is use for their identif by the analysi of spectral line differ kind of spectra are often use in chemic spectroscopi e g ir microwav nmr esr etc spectroscopi is also use to identifi the composit of remot object like star and distant galaxi by analyz their radiat spectra emiss spectrum of iron the term chemic energi is often use to indic the potenti of a chemic substanc to undergo a transform through a chemic reaction or to transform other chemic substanc reaction main articl chemic reaction dure chemic reaction bond between atom break and form result in differ substanc with differ properti in a blast furnac iron oxid a compound react with carbon monoxid to form iron one of the chemic element and carbon dioxid when a chemic substanc is transform as a result of it interact with anoth substanc or with energi a chemic reaction is said to have occur a chemic reaction is therefor a concept relat to the reaction of a substanc when it come in close contact with anoth whether as a mixtur or a solut exposur to some form of energi or both it result in some energi exchang between the constitu of the reaction as well as with the system environ which may be design vessel often laboratori glasswar chemic reaction can result in the format or dissoci of molecul that is molecul break apart to form two or more molecul or rearrang of atom within or across molecul chemic reaction usual involv the make or break of chemic bond oxid reduct dissoci acid base neutral and molecular rearrang are some exampl of common chemic reaction a chemic reaction can be symbol depict through a chemic equat while in a non nuclear chemic reaction the number and kind of atom on both side of the equat are equal for a nuclear reaction thi hold true onli for the nuclear particl viz proton and neutron 32 the sequenc of step in which the reorgan of chemic bond may be take place in the cours of a chemic reaction is call it mechan a chemic reaction can be envis to take place in a number of step each of which may have a differ speed mani reaction intermedi with variabl stabil can thu be envisag dure the cours of a reaction reaction mechan are propos to explain the kinet and the rel product mix of a reaction mani physic chemist special in explor and propos the mechan of variou chemic reaction sever empir rule like the woodward hoffmann rule often come in handi while propos a mechan for a chemic reaction accord to the iupac gold book a chemic reaction is a process that result in the interconvers of chemic speci 33 accordingli a chemic reaction may be an elementari reaction or a stepwis reaction an addit caveat is made in that thi definit includ case where the interconvers of conform is experiment observ such detect chemic reaction normal involv set of molecular entiti as indic by thi definit but it is often conceptu conveni to use the term also for chang involv singl molecular entiti i e microscop chemic event ion and salt the crystal lattic structur of potassium chlorid kcl a salt which is form due to the attract of k cation and cl anion the overal charg of the ionic compound is zero main articl ion an ion is a charg speci an atom or a molecul that ha lost or gain one or more electron when an atom lose an electron and thu ha more proton than electron the atom is a posit charg ion or cation when an atom gain an electron and thu ha more electron than proton the atom is a neg charg ion or anion cation and anion can form a crystallin lattic of neutral salt such as the na and cl ion form sodium chlorid or nacl exampl of polyatom ion that do not split up dure acid base reaction are hydroxid oh and phosphat po 4 3 plasma is compos of gaseou matter that ha been complet ioniz usual through high temperatur acid and basic hydrogen bromid exist in the ga phase as a diatom molecul main articl acid base reaction a substanc can often be classifi as an acid or a base there are sever differ theori which explain acid base behavior the simplest is arrheniu theori which state that an acid is a substanc that produc hydronium ion when it is dissolv in water and a base is one that produc hydroxid ion when dissolv in water accord to brønsted lowri acid base theori acid are substanc that donat a posit hydrogen ion to anoth substanc in a chemic reaction by extens a base is the substanc which receiv that hydrogen ion a third common theori is lewi acid base theori which is base on the format of new chemic bond lewi theori explain that an acid is a substanc which is capabl of accept a pair of electron from anoth substanc dure the process of bond format while a base is a substanc which can provid a pair of electron to form a new bond there are sever other way in which a substanc may be classifi as an acid or a base as is evid in the histori of thi concept 34 acid strength is commonli measur by two method one measur base on the arrheniu definit of acid is ph which is a measur of the hydronium ion concentr in a solut as express on a neg logarithm scale thu solut that have a low ph have a high hydronium ion concentr and can be said to be more acid the other measur base on the brønsted lowri definit is the acid dissoci constant k a which measur the rel abil of a substanc to act as an acid under the brønsted lowri definit of an acid that is substanc with a higher k a are more like to donat hydrogen ion in chemic reaction than those with lower k a valu redox main articl redox redox red uction ox idat reaction includ all chemic reaction in which atom have their oxid state chang by either gain electron reduct or lose electron oxid substanc that have the abil to oxid other substanc are said to be oxid and are known as oxid agent oxid or oxid an oxid remov electron from anoth substanc similarli substanc that have the abil to reduc other substanc are said to be reduct and are known as reduc agent reduct or reduc a reduct transfer electron to anoth substanc and is thu oxid itself and becaus it donat electron it is also call an electron donor oxid and reduct properli refer to a chang in oxid number the actual transfer of electron may never occur thu oxid is better defin as an increas in oxid number and reduct as a decreas in oxid number equilibrium main articl chemic equilibrium although the concept of equilibrium is wide use across scienc in the context of chemistri it aris whenev a number of differ state of the chemic composit are possibl as for exampl in a mixtur of sever chemic compound that can react with one anoth or when a substanc can be present in more than one kind of phase a system of chemic substanc at equilibrium even though have an unchang composit is most often not static molecul of the substanc continu to react with one anoth thu give rise to a dynam equilibrium thu the concept describ the state in which the paramet such as chemic composit remain unchang over time chemic law main articl chemic law chemic reaction are govern by certain law which have becom fundament concept in chemistri some of them are avogadro s law beer lambert law boyl s

proport raoult s law histori main articl histori of chemistri for a chronolog guid see timelin of chemistri the histori of chemistri span a period from the ancient past to the present sinc sever millennia bc civil were use technolog that would eventu form the basi of the variou branch of chemistri exampl includ extract metal from ore make potteri and glaze ferment beer and wine extract chemic from plant for medicin and perfum render fat into soap make glass and make alloy like bronz chemistri wa preced by it protosci alchemi which oper a non scientif approach to understand the constitu of matter and their interact despit be unsuccess in explain the natur of matter and it transform alchemist set the stage for modern chemistri by perform experi and record the result robert boyl although skeptic of element and convinc of alchemi play a key part in elev the sacr art as an independ fundament and philosoph disciplin in hi work the sceptic chymist 1661 35 while both alchemi and chemistri are concern with matter and it transform the crucial differ wa given by the scientif method that chemist employ in their work chemistri as a bodi of knowledg distinct from alchemi becam an establish scienc with the work of antoin lavoisi who develop a law of conserv of mass that demand care measur and quantit observ of chemic phenomena the histori of chemistri afterward is intertwin with the histori of thermodynam especi through the work of willard gibb 36 definit the definit of chemistri ha chang over time as new discoveri and theori add to the function of the scienc the term chymistri in the view of note scientist robert boyl in 1661 meant the subject of the materi principl of mix bodi 37 in 1663 the chemist christoph glaser describ chymistri as a scientif art by which one learn to dissolv bodi and draw from them the differ substanc on their composit and how to unit them again and exalt them to a higher perfect 38 the 1730 definit of the word chemistri as use by georg ernst stahl meant the art of resolv mix compound or aggreg bodi into their principl and of compos such bodi from those principl 39 in 1837 jean baptist duma consid the word chemistri to refer to the scienc concern with the law and effect of molecular forc 40 thi definit further evolv until in 1947 it came to mean the scienc of substanc their structur their properti and the reaction that chang them into other substanc a character accept by linu paul 41 more recent in 1998 professor raymond chang broaden the definit of chemistri to mean the studi of matter and the chang it undergo 42 background see also alchemi democritu atomist philosophi wa later adopt by epicuru 341 270 bce earli civil such as the egyptian 43 babylonian and indian 44 amass practic knowledg concern the art of metallurgi potteri and dye but did not develop a systemat theori a basic chemic hypothesi first emerg in classic greec with the theori of four element as propound definit by aristotl state that fire air earth
