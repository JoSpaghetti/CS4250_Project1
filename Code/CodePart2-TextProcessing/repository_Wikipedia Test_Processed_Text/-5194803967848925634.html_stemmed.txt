a term deriv from φύσις phúsi origin natur properti 6 7 8 ancient astronomi main articl histori of astronomi ancient egyptian astronomi is evid in monument like the ceil of senemut s tomb from the eighteenth dynasti of egypt astronomi is one of the oldest natur scienc earli civil date befor 3000 bce such as the sumerian ancient egyptian and the indu valley civilis had a predict knowledg and a basic awar of the motion of the sun moon and star the star and planet believ to repres god were often worship while the explan for the observ posit of the star were often unscientif and lack in evid these earli observ laid the foundat for later astronomi as the star were found to travers great circl across the sky 5 which could not explain the posit of the planet accord to asger aabo the origin of western astronomi can be found in mesopotamia and all western effort in the exact scienc are descend from late babylonian astronomi 9 egyptian astronom left monument show knowledg of the constel and the motion of the celesti bodi 10 while greek poet homer wrote of variou celesti object in hi iliad and odyssey later greek astronom provid name which are still use today for most constel visibl

verif of deduc statement aristotl s foundat work in physic though veri imperfect form a framework against which later thinker further develop the field hi approach is entir supersed today he explain idea such as motion and graviti with the theori of four element aristotl believ that each of the four classic element air fire water earth had it own natur place 15 becaus of their differ densiti each element will revert to it own specif place in the atmospher 16 so becaus of their weight fire would be at the top air underneath fire then water then lastli earth he also state that when a small amount of one element enter the natur place of anoth the less abund element will automat go toward it own natur place for exampl if there is a fire on the ground the flame go up into the air in an attempt to go back into it natur place where it belong hi law of motion includ that heavier object will fall faster the speed be proport to the weight and the speed of the object that is fall depend invers on the densiti object it is fall through e g densiti of air 17 he also state that when it come to violent motion motion of an object when a forc is appli to it by a second object that the speed that object move will onli be as fast or strong as the measur of forc appli to it 17 the problem of motion and it caus wa studi care lead to the philosoph notion of a prime mover as the ultim sourc of

avicenna the most notabl work wa the book of optic also known as kitāb al manāẓir written by ibn al haytham in which he present the altern to the ancient greek idea about vision 22 hi discuss hi

in the earli 20th centuri with the work of max planck in quantum theori and albert einstein s theori of rel both of these theori came about due to inaccuraci in classic mechan in certain situat classic mechan predict that the speed of light depend on the motion of the observ which could not be resolv with the constant speed predict by maxwel s equat of electromagnet thi discrep wa correct by

classic physic and modern physic with the latter categori includ effect relat to quantum mechan and rel 31 2 classic physic is gener concern with matter and energi on the normal scale of observ while much of modern physic is concern with the behavior of matter and energi under extrem condit or on a veri larg or veri small scale for exampl atom and nuclear physic studi matter on the smallest scale at which chemic element can be identifi the physic of elementari particl is on an even smaller scale sinc it is concern with the most basic unit of matter thi branch of physic is also known as high energi physic becaus of the extrem high energi necessari to produc mani type of particl in particl acceler on thi scale ordinari commonsens notion of space time matter and energi are no longer valid 41 the two chief theori of modern physic present a differ pictur of the concept of space time and matter from that present by classic physic classic mechan approxim natur as continu while quantum theori is concern with the discret natur of mani phenomena at the atom and subatom level and with the complementari aspect of particl and wave in the descript of such phenomena the theori of rel is concern with the descript of phenomena that take place in a frame of refer that is in motion with respect to an observ the special theori of rel is concern with motion in the absenc of gravit field and the gener theori of rel with motion and it connect with gravit both quantum theori and the theori of rel find applic in mani area of modern physic 42 fundament concept in modern physic includ

method approach to compar the implic of a theori with the conclus drawn from it relat experi and observ physicist are better abl to test the valid of a theori in a logic unbias and repeat way to that end experi are perform and observ are made in order to determin the valid or invalid of a theori 43 a scientif law is a concis verbal or mathemat statement of a relat that express a fundament principl

mccandless lightn is an electr current theorist seek to develop mathemat model that both agre with exist experi and success predict futur experiment result while experimentalist devis and perform experi to test theoret predict and explor new phenomena although theori and experi are develop separ they strongli affect and depend upon each other progress in physic frequent come about when experiment result defi explan by exist theori prompt intens focu on applic model and when new theori gener experiment testabl predict which inspir the develop of new experi and often relat equip 45 physicist who work at the interplay of theori and experi are call phenomenologist who studi complex phenomena observ in experi and work to relat them to a fundament theori 46 theoret physic ha histor

theorist invok these idea in hope of solv particular problem with exist theori they then explor the consequ of these idea and work toward make testabl predict experiment physic expand and is expand by engin and technolog experiment physicist who are involv in basic research design and perform experi with equip such as particl acceler and laser wherea those involv in appli research often work in

model the natur world with theori usual quantit here the path of a particl is model with the mathemat of calculu to explain it behavior the purview of the branch of physic known as mechan physic cover a wide rang of phenomena from elementari particl such as quark neutrino and electron to the largest superclust of galaxi includ in these phenomena are the most basic object compos all other thing therefor physic is sometim call the fundament scienc 48 physic aim to describ the variou phenomena that occur in natur in term of simpler phenomena thu physic aim to both connect the thing observ to human to root caus and then connect these caus togeth for exampl the ancient chines observ that certain rock lodeston and magnetit were attract to one anoth by an invis forc thi effect wa later call magnet which wa first rigor studi in the 17th centuri but even befor the chines discov magnet the ancient greek knew of other object such as amber that when rub with fur would caus a similar invis attract between the two 49 thi wa also first studi rigor in the 17th centuri and came to be call electr thu physic had come to understand two observ of natur in term of some root caus electr and magnet howev further work in the 19th centuri reveal that these two forc were just two differ aspect of one forc electromagnet thi process of unifi forc continu today and electromagnet and the weak
