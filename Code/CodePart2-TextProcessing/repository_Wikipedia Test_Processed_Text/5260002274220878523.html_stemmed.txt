the b 29d wa to incorpor consider chang in addit to the engin instal test in the xb 44 the use of a new alloy of aluminum 75 s rather than the exist 24st gave a wing that wa both stronger and lighter while the undercarriag wa strengthen to allow the aircraft to oper at weight of up to 40 000 pound 18 000 kg greater than the b 29 a larger vertic fin and rudder which could fold to allow the aircraft
